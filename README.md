# Weather App

I've created a weather app in which you can see the current weather in Stockholm and a forecast over the next days as well. 


## The problem

I had a few problems in this project. The hardest problem I faced was logging the 5 coming days from the API. What I'm striving to do next is to implement geolocation so the user can see the weather where he or she is at the moment based on their gps.
